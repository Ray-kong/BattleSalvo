# Changelog PA03 -> PA04

### Changed the computer player's takeShots() to be algorithmic as opposed to random.
- In order to achieve this we added a ShootingStrategy Utility class that generates shots given the current state
- Added HitGroup utility to find groups of shots
current state of the board.
### Changed all player implementations
- Change Public fields to public getter methods

* We didn't change that much about PA03 besides the computer algorithm.
